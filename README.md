# 🏥 Parkinson's Disease Regression Analysis  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project explores **Parkinson’s Disease severity prediction** using multiple regression models. By analyzing various clinical and vocal measurements, we aim to build an effective machine learning model that can estimate the severity of the disease.  

---

## 📊 Dataset Information  
The dataset includes patient medical attributes such as:  

- **motor_updrs** – Motor subscore of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale  
- **total_updrs** – Total UPDRS score (Target Variable)  
- **age** – Patient’s age  
- **jitter & shimmer** – Acoustic measures of voice impairment  
- **sex** – Encoded as a numerical feature  
- **Other relevant clinical features...**  

**🔹 Target Column:** `motor_updrs` (disease severity score)

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Implemented  
This project evaluates **10 different regression models**:  

✔ **Linear Regression**  
✔ **Decision Tree Regressor**  
✔ **Random Forest Regressor**  
✔ **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
✔ **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  
✔ **XGBoost Regressor**  
✔ **LightGBM Regressor**  
✔ **CatBoost Regressor**  
✔ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor**  
✔ **Neural Network Regression (MLP)**  

Models are compared using:  
📌 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
📌 **R² Score**  
📌 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
